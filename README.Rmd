### Title 

Exploring Health Expenditure using State-level data 

Health policy in the United States is complicated, and several 
forms of healthcare coverage exist, including both federal 
goverment-led healthcare policy, and private insurance company.
Before making any inference about the relationship between 
health condition and health policy, it is important for us to 
have a general idea about healthcare economics in the United 
States. Thus, We are interested in getting sense of the health
expenditure, including healthcare coverage and healthcare spending,
across the United States.  

### Motivating questions

1. Is there a relationship between healthcare coverage and
healthcare spending in the United States?   
2. How does the spending distribution change across geographic 
regions in the Unied States?  
3. Does the relationship between healthcare coverage and 
healthcare spending in the United States change from 2013 to 2014?  

### Data

The data for this demonstration come from
[Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)](https://www.kff.org). 

- [Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/)
  - Includes years 2013-2016
  
- [Health Care Expenditures by State of Residence (in millions)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-care-expenditures-by-state-of-residence-in-millions/)
  - Includes years 1991-2014
 
For educational purposes, the data have been downloaded 
and relative paths are used for this demonstration.
**Note**: If students are not familiar with relative paths,
it will be helpful to briefly introduce the idea for absolute
paths and relative paths.

We also introduce `library(datasets)` for States information.

### Analysis 

#### Data Import 

We use the R package `library(readr)` for data import in this tutorial.  

#### Data wrangling 

Two R package `library(tidyr)`, `library(dplyr)` are used for data wrangling in this tutorial.  

We explain what tidy data is, and further introduce the concepts of "wide format" 
and "long format." We also demonstrate how to convert from one format to the other using 
`gather()` and `spread()`.

We also demonstrate some other useful functions for data wrangling, including 
selecting columns using `select()`, 
Selecting rows using `filter()`, 
arranging or re-orderomg rows using `arrange()`, 
joining two datasets using `join()`, 
adding columns using `mutate()`, 
creating summaries of columns using `summarise()`, 
and grouping operations using `group_by()`. 

#### Data exploration (exploratory analysis)   

For exploratory analysis, we use data visulization for exploratory analysis. `ggplot2` is the R package 
we demonstrate in this tutorial. 

We explain how to create plots using `ggplot()` with basic syntax for `ggplot2`. 
We also demonstrate how to create scatter plots using `geom_point()`,
how to add layers of text using `geom_text()`, 
how to facet across a variable using `facet_wrap()`, 
how to create boxplots using `geom_boxplot()`, 
and how to facet by two variables using `facet_grid`. 

#### Summary   

The total healthcare expenditure is associated with 
the population. To make a fair comparison, 
we create "healthcare expenditure per capita." 
Further, the exploratory analysis via data visualization showed 
higher speding in healthcare per capita 
is positively associated with higher 
employer coverage proportion and is 
negatively associated with the porportion 
of uninsured population across the States. 

### Other notes and resources 

The libraries used in this study are `library(datasets)`, 
`library(tidyr)`, `library(dplyr)`, `ggplot2`, and 
`ggrepel`. In order to run this code please ensure 
you have these packages installed

For instructors:  

1. The objective of this tutorial is for student to get familiar with 
important skills in data science, including data import (`readr`), 
data wrangling (`dplyr`) , and data visualization (`ggplot2`) .    
2. This material is designed for 4.5 teaching hours. (One potential way 
to teach this tutorial is to divide the material into three 1.5 hour sessions. The 
first session focuses on data import, the second session focuses on data 
wrangling, and the third portion focuses on visualization.)    
3. The session starting with (*) can be made as exercise for students' practice.
